# Book Recommendation System Using K-Nearest Neighbors
This project implements a book recommendation system using the KNN model. It works on the concept of collaborative filtering where users
having similar taste in books are clustered together, in order to exploit the user-behaviour patterns. These clusters are later used to recommend books similar to the current user's taste.
Further, the model is extended to include the geographical location of users into the input features in order to recommend books based on their popularity in each continent.
